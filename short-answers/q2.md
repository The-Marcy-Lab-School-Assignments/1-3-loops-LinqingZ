# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
You can use `continue` to skip when i is greater than 7 so the function will looks like: 
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) contine;
  console.log(i)
}
```
Another way to do it is make the i < 7 so you don't need to check if i > 7.
